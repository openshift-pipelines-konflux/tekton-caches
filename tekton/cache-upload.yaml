      description: |
        Regular expression to select files to include to compute the hash.
        For example, in the case of a Go project, you can use `go.mod` for this, so the value would be "**/go.sum" (to work with possible sub go modules as well).
      type: array
    - name: target
      description: |
        The target from where the cache should be uploaded. It's a URI with the scheme defining the "provider". In addition, one can add a {{hash}} variable to use the computed hash in the reference (oci image tags, path in s3, â€¦)
        Currently supported:
        - oci:// (e.g. oci://quay.io/vdemeester/go-cache:{{hash}}
        - s3:// (e.g. s3://
      type: string
    - name: cachePath
      description: |
        Path where to extract the cache content.
        It can refer any folder, backed by a workspace or a volume, or nothing.
      type: string
    - name: workingdir
      description: |
        The working dir from where the files patterns needs to be taken

        Whether to use insecure mode for fetching the cache
      type: string
      default: "false"
  results: # Any result to "publish" ?
    - name: fetched
      description: |
        Whether a cache was fetched or not (true/false). This step won't fail if it didn't manage to fetch cache. This results allows the next step to act whether something was fetched or not.
